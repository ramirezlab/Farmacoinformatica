## Chemoinformatics analysis for computer-aided drug design (CADD)

This workflow consists of 5 interconnected work blocks, each containing a central theme in computer-aided drug design (CADD).

The workflow is presented using Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as an example, including its respective active compounds and their respective associated IC50 values, which where obtained from the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl" target="_blank"><b>CHEMBL</b></a> database. Our chemoinformatics analysis allows the user to:

+ List active and inactive compounds (according to the selected IC50 threshold).
+ Evaluate the compounds bioavailability and other properties which adversely affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of those  compounds, based on chemical structure alone.
+ Group compounds according to their structural similarity in order to expose activity patterns, or for novel compound construction through scaffold fusion.  From this grouping, a diverse set of compounds can also be selected for further analysis.
+ Calculate the common maximum substructure in a set of molecules.
+ Find a central structure (scaffold) within all active compounds, and identify its substituents at certain binding positions.

### 1. Data acquisition from <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl" target="_blank"><b>CHEMBL</b></a> 

Information related to the structure, bioactivity, and targets associated to a  compound are available in databases such as <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl" target="_blank"><b>CHEMBL</b></a>, <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/l" target="_blank"><b>PubChem</b></a>, or <a href="https://go.drugbank.com/" target="_blank"><b>DrugBank</b></a>. This data is obtained from <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl" target="_blank"><b>CHEMBL</b></a> where all compounds associated with the chosen target (Acetylcholinesterase AChE) which had an IC50 value, were filtered along with their respective Smiles and phase of study.

Active compounds were separated from inactive compounds using the following parameter:

Active IC50 < 5 µM

Inactive IC50 >5 µM

### 2 and 3. **Molecular filtering: ADME and lead-likeness criteria**

Not all compounds are suitable as a starting point for drug development due to their undesirable pharmacokinetic properties, which could adversely affect absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of a drug. Therefore, these compounds are usually excluded in datasets aiming to target promising drug candidates. Therefore, fewer drug-like molecules in the dataset should be eliminated.

The bioavailability of a compound is an important ADME property. Lipinski's rule of five was introduced to estimate the bioavailability of compounds based solely on their chemical structure. RO5 states that malabsorption or permeation of a compound is more likely to occur if the chemical structure violates more than one of the following rules:

+ Molecular weight (MWT) <= less than 500 Da.
+ Number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) <= no more than 10.
+ Number of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) <= 5 or less.
+ Calculated LogP (octanol-water coefficient) <= 5 or less.
+ Subsequently, those compounds complying with three or four of Lipinski's rules were filtered out for further chemometric analysis.

### 4. Compound clustering

Clustering can be used to identify groups of similar compounds, in order to pick a set of diverse compounds from these clusters for diverse goals like, for example,  non-redundant experimental testing. The following steps show how to create these clusters based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm.

### 4. Maximum common substructures

To visualize the shared scaffolds between compounds, and thus emphasize the extent and type of chemical similarities inside a cluster, the maximum common substructure (MCS) can be calculated and highlighted. In this workflow, the MCS was calculated for the four significant clusters obtained from the previous node using the FMCS algorithm.
